<h2>### Hi there ðŸ˜ƒ</h2>

I'm Daniel, a software engineer <i>currently<i/> based in Brazil.

My main technologies are React and TypeScript, but I'm really language agnostic and would work with any technologies necessary if I needed to. 

I think tech is more about different ways to achieve different goals, so I try not to get emotional about whatever I'm going to use in my projects.
